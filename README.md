# GiGS Music
a material design, simplistic music player for android

# Looks
![Alt text](screenshot.png?raw=true "The \"Now Playing\" screen")

# NOTES
This is my first android project. So, you should never expect it to be "The Perfect One" but yeah, it's good enough being the first try, I'd say.

To be added:

* Add to Playlist feature
* Preferences View
* An Equalizer (maybe)
* Visualisation (TBD)
* Navigation gestures
* Anything else I decide later...
